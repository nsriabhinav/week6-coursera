                <h2>Apple</h2>
                <p>
                    An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica).
                    Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus.
                    The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today.
                    Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists.
                    Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian tradition.

                <h2>Banana</h2>
                <p>
                    A banana is an elongated, edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.
                    In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called "plantains", distinguishing them from dessert bananas.
                    The fruit is variable in size, color, and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown when ripe. 
                    The fruits grow in clusters hanging from the top of the plant.

                <h2>Strawberry</h2>
                <p>
                    The garden strawberry (or simply strawberry; Fragaria × ananassa)[1] is a widely grown hybrid species of the genus Fragaria, collectively known as the strawberries, which are cultivated worldwide for their fruit.
                    The fruit is widely appreciated for its characteristic aroma, bright red color, juicy texture, and sweetness. It is consumed in large quantities, either fresh or in such prepared foods as jam, juice, pies, ice cream, milkshakes, and chocolates.
                    Artificial strawberry flavorings and aromas are also widely used in products.
